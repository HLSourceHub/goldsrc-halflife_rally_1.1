Everyone else who has submitted and/or located free textures.

=============================

Textures in this wad have been created by many of the team 
members including myself. We have made these textures available 
exclusively for Half-Life Rally use. If you wish to use these 
textures for other purposes you must contact the authors 
mentioned, or myself or diablone if its unclear.

The WAD also includes control textures like sky, clip, hint, 
etc, so that you wont need to use the halflife.wad anymore!

Some of the originals of these wads have been found in the archives 
of the old HL-Rally forums, so I'm unaware of any issues with 
whether they are for public use or not. If there are any problems, 
issues or whatever (there always is with this sort of thing) please 
politely contact me immediately!

I remind prospective HL-Rally mappers that the HL-Rally Team 
expects you to utilise these textures rather than HalfLife 
and CS textures to give the HL-Rally mod the unique total conversion
feel that we are striving the create.
