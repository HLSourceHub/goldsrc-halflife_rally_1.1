=============================

Textures in this wad have been created by many of the team 
members including myself. We have made these textures available 
exclusively for Half-Life Rally use. If you wish to use these 
textures for other purposes you must contact the authors 
mentioned, or myself if its unclear.

The WAD also includes control textures like sky, clip, hint, 
etc, so that you wont need to use the halflife.wad anymore!

The originals of these wads have been found in the archives of 
the old HL-Rally forums, so Im unaware of any issues with whether 
they are for public use or not. If there are any problems, issues 
or whatever (there always is with this sort of thing) please 
politely contact me immediately!

I remind prospective HL-Rally mappers that the HL-Rally Team 
expects you to utilise these many textures rather than HalfLife 
and counter-strike textures to give the HL-Rally mod much more 
of a unique feel!<BR>
