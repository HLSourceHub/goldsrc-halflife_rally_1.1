[Tyres]
{Sports}
Desc=Sports\n\nWhile they don't bring the same performance as the other tires, they are very cost effective.
Cost=300
Value=Handling + 3

{Performance}
Desc=Performance\n\nIf you want serious performance, these are the tires for you. Not quite rally quality, but still a great choice.
Cost=500
Value=Handling + 5

{Rally}
Desc=Rally\n\nUsed by rally teams across the world, these tires will provide the best traction of all.
Cost=700
Value=Handling + 7

[Exhaust]
{MidPipe}
Desc=MidPipe\n\nA midpipe replaces the stock Catalytic Converter to produce a smoother flow and reduce temperatures around the engine.
Cost=200
Value=TopSpeed + 4

{Cat-Back}
Desc=Cat-Back\n\nCat-Back Exhaust systems are the easist way to improve performance by removing poor flowing stock exhausts.
Cost=550
Value=TopSpeed + 6

{Turbo-Back}
Desc=Turbo-Back\n\nTurbo-Back Exhaust systems open up exhaust passages starting from the turbo, then going through a downpipe, followed by a high-flow Catalytic Converter and exiting through a high-flow muffler. Only avaliable for forced induction vehicles.
Cost=800
Value=TopSpeed + 8

[Intercooler]
{Small Core}
Desc=Small Core\n\nSmall Core Intecoolers are best fitted with smaller turbos to keep boost creep low or non-existent, while still allowing an increase in turbo boost.
Cost=1500
Value=Acceleration + 4

{Large Core}
Desc=Large Core\n\nLarge Core Intercoolers work best when matched with larger, single turbo systems where turbo boost will be vastly increased.
Cost=3100
Value=Acceleration + 8

[Turbo]
{Single Turbo}
Desc=Single Turbo\n\nA Single (larger) Turbo will flow more air molecules into the engine, which provides more power, but a more abrupt delivery.
Cost=4500
Value=TopSpeed + 15; Acceleration + 15

{Twin Turbo}
Desc=Twin Turbo\n\nTwin Turbo systems work together, to help reduce turbo-lag. The first turbo spins up quickly without much lag, while the second, larger turbo spins up for higher speeds to help increase boost.
Cost=3200
Value=TopSpeed + 8; Acceleration + 15
